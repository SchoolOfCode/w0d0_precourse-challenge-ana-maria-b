        Cardcaptors, originally known as ‘Cardcaptor Sakura’ started as a
        popular manga series in Japan in the 90’s. It tells the story of a young
        girl who discovers an old book containing magical cards which are
        released into her neighbourhood upon opening. She must use her own
        latent magical powers and the help of her friends to recapture the cards
        and save her town from catastrophe. <br />
        <br />
        Having been adapted into an anime series in 1998, it was later
        translated for English speaking countries in 2000. <br />
        <br />
        Although there were two main dubbed versions, Animax and Nelvana, it is
        generally agreed that Nelvana’s version is superior having been
        purchased and aired by powerhouses such as Cartoon Network, and
        Nickelodeon. <br />
        <br />
        One drawback of Nelvana’s better voice acting was that they heavily
        censored the original series, with many episodes being taken out
        altogether.<br />
        <br />
        Fans who wish to view all episodes are advised to watch Nelvana’s
        version first and then Animax’s for the ‘lost episodes’.<br />
        <br />
        Cardcaptors merchandise and cosplay memorabilia is highly prized, with
        copies of Sakura’s magic staff being sold for over £200 - bear in mind
        this is a cheap piece of plastic with no real magical powers!<br />
        <br />

        I hope you enjoy it as much as I do, it’s definitely a series you can
        binge and re-watch time and again.
